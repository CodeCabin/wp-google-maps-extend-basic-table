# wp-google-maps-extend-basic-table

This small plugin shows an example of how to extend the built in Basic Table style marker listing.

You can use WordPress' hooks to return your own class, and direct the plugin to load marker listing HTML from a different folder from there.

This will allow you full control over the marker listing list item HTML in a manner which won't break when you update the plugin, as it's completely external.
